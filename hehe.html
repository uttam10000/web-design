        <h1>ROMAN REIGN(THE BIG DOG)</h1>
        <p>Leati Joseph "Joe" Anoa'i (born May 25, 1985) is an American professional wrestler and former football player. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand under the ring name Roman Reigns. He is the leader of The Bloodline and is the current and longest-reigning WWE Universal Champion in his second reign, as well as the current WWE Champion in his fourth reign, making him WWE's undisputed world champion. He is a member of wrestling's Anoa'i family, which also includes his father Sika Anoa'i; brother Rosey; and cousins Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Rikishi, Solo Sikoa, The Tonga Kid, Yokozuna, and Umaga.[4]

            After playing college football for Georgia Tech, Anoa'i started his professional football career with brief off-season stints with the Minnesota Vikings and Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL) in 2007. He then played a full season for the Canadian Football League's (CFL) Edmonton Eskimos in 2008 before his release and retirement from football. He then pursued a career in professional wrestling and was signed by WWE in 2010, reporting to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). Under the ring name Roman Reigns, he made his main roster debut in November 2012 alongside Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins as The Shield. The trio teamed together until June 2014, after which Reigns entered singles competition.
            
            Reigns is a six-time world champion in WWE, having held the WWE Championship four times and the WWE Universal Championship twice. In 2022, he became the longest reigning Universal Champion at 836+ days, which is recognized as the sixth-longest world championship reign in the promotion's history. He is also a one-time WWE United States Champion, a one-time WWE Intercontinental Champion, a one-time WWE Tag Team Champion (with Rollins), the 2015 Royal Rumble winner, and the 2014 Superstar of the Year. He tied the WWE record for most eliminations in a Survivor Series match with four in the 2013 event and also previously held the record for most eliminations in a Royal Rumble match with 12 in the 2014 event. Upon winning the Intercontinental Championship, he became the twenty-eighth Triple Crown Champion and the seventeenth Grand Slam Champion. Reigns has headlined numerous pay-per-view events, including WWE's flagship event WrestleMania six times (31, 32, 33, 34, 37, and 38).[8][9] Additionally, Reigns was ranked number one in Pro Wrestling Illustrated's annual PWI 500 list of the top 500 singles wrestlers in 2016 and 2022.[10]

            
            From 2014 onwards, WWE attempted to establish Reigns as their next "face of the company", positioning him as a heroic character, which was met with intense disapproval by audiences and critics.[11] However, following his return in August 2020, Reigns was repackaged as a new villainous character, "The Tribal Chief", which was generally met with acclaim;[12][13][14][15] this revamped persona was named Best Gimmick by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter in 2021.[16] By the end of that year, however, complaints of overexposure and staleness began to resurface in the wrestling media.</p>

                <h2>EARLY LIFE</h2>
                <p><b>'Leati Joseph Anoa'</b> was born in Pensacola, Florida, on May 25, 1985.[20][5] He is of Arbëreshë, English, Italian, and Samoan descent.[note 1][22] Both his father Sika, and his brother Rosey (1970–2017), were professional wrestlers.[23] As a member of the Anoa'i family, he is a cousin to former professional wrestlers Yokozuna (1966–2000), Rikishi, Umaga (1973–2009), The Tonga Kid and first cousin once-removed to The Usos and The Rock (non-biological).[23][24] Anoa'i attended Pensacola Catholic High School and Escambia High School,[5] before going on to major in management at the Georgia Institute of Technology.[5] </p>
                <h2>PROFESSIONAL WRESTLIG CARRER</h2>
                <p>Anoa'i signed a contract with WWE in 2010 and was later assigned to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW).[20] He made his televised debut on August 19, 2010, using the ring name Roman Leakee, in a 15-man battle royal, which was won by Alex Riley.[29] On the January 16, 2011 episode of FCW, Leakee was a competitor in a 30-man Grand Royal, but was eliminated.[30] Later in 2011, Leakee formed a tag team with Donny Marlow and the pair unsuccessfully challenged Calvin Raines and Big E Langston for the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship on July 8.[31]

                    In January 2012, Leakee pinned FCW Florida Heavyweight Champion Leo Kruger in a non-title match.[32] On the February 5 episode of FCW, he defeated Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins in a triple threat match to become the number one contender to the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship.[33] He failed to win the championship when he lost to Kruger the following week.[34] Leakee later won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship with Mike Dalton[35][36] and would drop the titles to CJ Parker and Jason Jordan shortly after.[37]
                    
                    After WWE rebranded FCW to NXT in August 2012,[38] Anoa'i, with the new ring name of Roman Reigns and a villain character, made his debut on the October 31 episode of NXT by defeating CJ Parker.[39]</p>
                    <h2>WWE World Heavyweight Champion (2015–2016)</h2>
                    <p>On the October 26 episode of Raw, Reigns defeated Alberto Del Rio, Dolph Ziggler and Kevin Owens in a fatal four way to become the number one contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.[111][112] However, champion Seth Rollins legitimately injured his knee on November 4 and vacated the title the following day, which led to a tournament to crown a new champion.[113] Reigns defeated Big Show in the first round,[114] Cesaro in the quarterfinals,[115] Alberto Del Rio in the semifinals[116] and Dean Ambrose in the finals at Survivor Series on November 22 to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship for the first time.[117] Immediately afterward, Sheamus cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated Reigns, thus ending Reigns' reign at only 5 minutes.[118][119] On December 13, Reigns failed to regain the title from Sheamus in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs following interference by The League of Nations (Alberto Del Rio and Rusev), attacking Triple H in anger after the match.[120]

                        The next night on Raw, Vince McMahon granted Reigns a title rematch against Sheamus, under the stipulation that if Reigns lost, he would be forced to retire. Reigns managed to win after overcoming interferences from McMahon, Del Rio and Rusev, regaining the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in the process.[121] McMahon then forced Reigns to defend his title in the 2016 Royal Rumble match on January 24.[122] In the match, Reigns was eliminated by Triple H, who won the match, thus losing the championship.[123] At Fastlane on February 22, Reigns defeated Brock Lesnar and Dean Ambrose in a triple threat match to receive a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match against Triple H at WrestleMania 32 on April 3,[124] where he defeated Triple H in the main event to become the WWE World Heavyweight Champion for a third time.[125] After WrestleMania, Reigns began a feud with AJ Styles and successfully defended the championship against him at Payback on May 1[126] and then again at Extreme Rules in an Extreme Rules match on May 22.[127] After the latter match, Reigns was attacked by a returning Seth Rollins.[128]
                        
                        At Money in the Bank on June 19, Reigns lost to Rollins, marking his first clean loss on the main roster and ending his reign at 77 days.[129] On June 21, Anoaʻi was legitimately suspended by WWE for 30 days due to violating the WWE Wellness Program, WWE's internal drug testing program.[130][131] Pro Wrestling Torch and TheWrap reported that WWE knew of Anoaʻi's violation before the event, leading to Reigns being scripted to lose his world title at the event.[132][133]
                        
                        On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Reigns was drafted to the Raw brand.[134] Despite Reigns's suspension, WWE continued to advertise Reigns as part of the Battleground main event,[135] and went on to acknowledge Reigns's suspension on television.[136] At Battleground on July 24, Reigns made his televised return, facing Rollins and Dean Ambrose for the now-renamed WWE Championship,[137] which Ambrose won.[138] The following night on Raw, Reigns also failed to contend for the newly announced WWE Universal Championship against Rollins at SummerSlam on August 21, as he lost to the debuting Finn Bálor in a qualifying match.[139]</p>
